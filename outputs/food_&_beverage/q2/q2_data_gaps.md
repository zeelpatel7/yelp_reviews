# Q2 — Data Gaps to Close

**Channel & fulfillment**
- Tag reviews by channel (dine-in vs. each delivery provider) to de-bias delivery effects.
- Capture promised vs actual ETA; packaging quality rubric.

**Ambience & operations**
- TV count / zones, noise level, lighting policy, patio seat count, table size mix, average wait time, reservation outcomes.
- Parking counts by type (street/lot/garage/validated/valet) and policy hours.

**Menu metadata**
- Count and share of vegan/gluten-free items; mark seasonal/limited-time items.
- Photo coverage: # of recent photos, outdoor seating images, menu photos; last listing update date.

**Geo context (controls)**
- Neighborhood foot-traffic, income, POI density — to separate operations from location advantage.

**Measurement**
- Simple change log: date + attribute toggled (e.g., “added outdoor seating photos,” “reduced TVs”).
- Weekly roll-up: % reviews > 4.5 (F&B), review volume, listing impressions → clicks → calls.
